## Exploratory Financial Data Analysis Using Python

In this project, I conducted an exploratory data analysis of the stock prices of various banks, examining their performance before, during, and after the 2008 financial crisis until 2016. To accomplish this, I utilized several powerful Python libraries including NumPy, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Plotly, and Cufflinks.

"Through this exploratory financial data analysis project, I was able to gain valuable insights into the performance of different banks during the financial crisis and beyond. I analysed stock prices of multiple banks, and answered key questions such as:

•	How did different banks perform during the financial crisis, and how did they recover in the years that followed?

•	What factors influenced the stock prices of different banks during this time period?

•	Were there any notable trends or patterns in the stock prices of different banks over time?

•	How did the performance of different banks compare to each other, and to the broader market?
